                          MediaBugs.org Bug Tracker
                          =========================

This is the source distribution for the code that runs MediaBugs.org.
Please report bugs at http://code.google.com/p/mediabugs-open/issues/.
MediaBugs-open is based on the PeoplePods.net library developed by Ben
Brown; see PeoplePods.net for more information.

Installation Instructions:

  1. Make sure these packages are installed.  These instructions are
     based on Debian and Ubuntu GNU/Linux systems -- if you're on
     something different, please adjust accordingly.  We assume you
     have apache2 httpd already installed.

     # apt-get update
     # apt-get install php5       /* See troubleshooting note (1) below. */
     # apt-get install php5-mysql  

  2. Create the database:

     # mysqld &                   /* Start up mysqld only if not running. */
     # mysql -u root
     mysql> create database mediabugs;
     mysql> grant all on mediabugs.* to mediabugsrw@localhost
            identified by 'changeme';
     mysql> flush privileges;
     mysql> quit
     # 

  3. Put the mediabugs-open directory wherever web pages are normally
     served from: 

     # cp -a mediabugs-open /var/www/mediabugs

     (You could put it in "/var/www/whatever"; these instructions
     assume "mediabugs".  And you could serve directly out of this
     working copy, if you're doing development work on mediabugs.
     E.g., 'ln -s /path/to/mediabugs-open /var/www/mediabugs'.)

     # chown -R www-data.www-data /var/www/mediabugs

     (For 'www-data', use whatever user.group your webserver runs as.)

  4. Make sure apache2 is configured to allow .htaccess overrides.
     Something like this in your httpd.conf or wherever:

     <Directory /var/www/>
         AllowOverride All
         Order allow,deny
         allow from all
     </Directory>

  5. Deploy!

       $ cd /var/www/mediabugs
       $ make deploy

     Note that the first time you do this, it will pull down the
     peoplepods library from http://code.google.com/p/peoplepods.

  6. Browse to http://yourserver/mediabugs/peoplepods -- you're in!
     The rest of the setup takes place via the web admin interface.

     You will be prompted for the database info and for a few steps
     after that.  ("/mediabugs/peoplepods" is the web admin area;
     you'll use it a lot).

  7. When you get to the "Plugin Pods" page during the setup, there
     will be a long list of pods, with checkboxes on the right.  Only
     a few will be already checked.  Make sure all of the following
     are turned on (sorry, I don't know a way to avoid this laborious
     task):

       bugs_profiles
       akismet
       openid_connect
       contact_form
       bugs_reports
       bugs_send_this
       bugs_subscriptions
       bugs_authentication_login
       bugs_authentication_creation
       bugs_cron
       bugs_api
       bugs_moderation
       contenttype_bug_add
       contenttype_bug_browse
       contenttype_bug_feeds
       contenttype_bug_bugfeeds
       contenttype_bug_view
       contenttype_bug_list
       bugs_home
       facebook_connect
       email_everyone
       twitter_connect
       custom_img
       bugs_features
       bugs_lists
       mime_send
       core_pages
       bugs_dashboard
       toggle_bot

     You should also turn OFF the following pods, which may still be
     checked on by default:

       core_dashboard
       core_authentication_login
       core_api_simple

     (Often when things aren't behaving right, it's because the wrong
     pod was somehow still accidentally enabled after this step.)

  8. Set the theme.  Click "Options" in the left vertical
     nav, then click "Activate" for the "MediaBugs Theme".

  9. Set the API key.  Again go to "Options", and the API Key field is
     on the "Site Options" tab.  Use this key...

     287b8336ef3aa6360dfbe55ee4b1beab

     ...or obtain one from PeoplePods.net.  See
     http://code.google.com/p/peoplepods/issues/detail?id=1 for
     discussion of whether this step will be required in the future.

 10. Create a new user named "Anonymous", starting from the "People"
     link in the left-side vertical nav panel.  This user is necessary
     for anonymous bug reporting to work properly.

 11. It's all set up.  Click "View Site" at the bottom of the left
     vertical nav panel, and try "Report a bug".

Troubleshooting notes:
----------------------

1) PHP will need the mbfl library enabled to provide 'mbstring'.  If
   your packaged PHP doesn't have that by default, then try 'apt-get
   install php5-mbstring', or else recompile PHP from source with the
   --enable-mbfl flag, reinstall it, and don't forget to restart apache2.
